                Thanks for taking a moment to get to know me and my journey to becoming a web developer. I'm an Indiana native living in Indianapolis, working remotely under the scrutinous supervision of my dogs.

                I've often been accused of hobby-hopping, moving between interests such as woodworking, performing live music, 3D printing, and video game development using C# in the Unity engine. This accusation led me to a realization that I love <em><u>learning</u></em> and that I love to <em><u>create</u></em> things for others to enjoy.

                Prior to my time as a web developer, I enjoyed eleven years at a local software company, split between two different roles: Technical Support and Education Specialist. Through these positions, I gained a deep understanding for the importance of communcication and a passion for creating meaningful and engaging resources available to a wide audience.

                I'm currently attending the Eleven Fifty Acadamy, mastering a wide array of web development tools, with the expectation to graduate in December of 2021.
